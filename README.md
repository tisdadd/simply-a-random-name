# simply-a-random-name

The _potential_ usefulness of this package is if you require just a random name. 

However, what this is really designed for is to generate github activity to see how that affects displays of certain things. As I am sure many people looking at this have encountered - not every company uses github, but most companies when applying would like a github link. Or, you may have to have a separate github should you use it - I myself have had that, as well as Azure repos and GitLab commonly in the past.

So, basically this should make the profile running it have a reasonable amount of activity, but also could be used to get a single random semi-static name (static to the version) at any given time.
